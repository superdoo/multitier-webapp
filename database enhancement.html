âœ… Phase 1: Full Database Design and Deployment

Goals:

    Design multiple related tables (e.g., users, orders, products).

    Deploy them inside your PostgreSQL database in Kubernetes.

Steps:

    Define your schema (ERD) â€“ letâ€™s start simple:

        users(id, name, email)

        products(id, name, price)

        orders(id, user_id, product_id, quantity)

    Create a SQL migration script to initialize the schema.

    Mount this SQL script to your PostgreSQL Helm chart (or apply manually).

    Test data insertion and confirm backend can query it.

âœ… Phase 2: Backend API Enhancements

Goals:

    Add API endpoints to handle form submissions and return structured data.

Steps:

    Add POST endpoint like /api/submit-order to accept data from the form.

    Add GET endpoints to fetch users, products, or order summaries.

    Connect the new endpoints to the PostgreSQL tables via queries.

âœ… Phase 3: Frontend UX/UI + Form Integration

Goals:

    Add a clean, styled HTML form.

    Display submitted data visually (e.g., table or list).

    Improve overall design using CSS or a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind.

Steps:

    Add a form (e.g., for submitting an order: select user, product, quantity).

    Add JavaScript to call the backend (via fetch or Axios).

    Style your HTML using a UI framework or a template.
