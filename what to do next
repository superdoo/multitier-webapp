What we can do next:

    Test the full backend API functionality
    Check all your API endpoints and make sure they respond as expected.

    Connect the frontend (if you have one)
    Make sure the frontend app (maybe in another namespace) can communicate with the backend service.

    Setup database connectivity
    Verify the backend can reach your Postgres database at postgres.database.svc.cluster.local with the right credentials.

    Add ingress (optional)
    Set up an Ingress controller and ingress resource if you want nicer URLs (no NodePort and IP needed).

    Monitoring & Logging
    Add some logging or monitoring so you can watch your appâ€™s health.

    Test API?

    Setup frontend?

    Database?
